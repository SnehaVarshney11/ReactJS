# All about ReactJS

â€¼ <b>What is React?</b>  <br>
* It is an open source JS library for building user interfaces. It is focus on doing one thing. Not focus on other like routing or http request only focus to build UI. <br>
* Created and Maintained by Facebook. <br>
* It has Component Based Architecture. (like header, footer, sidenav etc...) <br>
* Reusable Code  <br>
* Declarative -> Tell only what you want and react will build the actual UI <br>
* It'll fit everywhere whether it is portion of any page, complete page oe entire app itself. <br>

â€¼ <b>Create React Application - </b>  <br>
1. Using npx <br>
run - npx create-react-app app-name <br>
cd app-name <br> npm run start <br>
2. Using npm <br>
run - npm install create-react-app -g <br>
run - create-react-app<app-name> <br>

â€¼ <b>Components -</b>  <br>
<img src="/Assests/Component.png" alt="Component"> <br>
* They are reusable. <br>
* Component code is placed on JavaScript file. E.g.- AppComponent is placed in App.js <br>
* There are 2 types of component -

1. Stateless Functional Component - Like as JS Function, return HTML (JSX) which describes the UI. Need to import only one component i.e. React
```
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Welcome, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

2. Stateful Class Component - Like regular ES6 classes that extend component class from react library. Must contain render method which return HTML. Need to import two components i.e. React and component class from react. <br>
<b>create class and class should be extend component and class has to implement render function which will return null or some HTML. </b>
```
class Welcome extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return <h1>Welcome, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}
```

â€¼ <b>Difference between both components -</b> 
<img src="/Assests/DiffBetweenComponents.png" alt="Both Components"> <br>
Note:- Functional comp isn't stateless. 

â€¼ <b>JSX -</b> 
1. JavaScript XML is a extension to JS lang syntax. 
2. Write XML-like code for XML and Components.
3. JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children. 
4. We can write react code without JSX but JSX makes react code simpler and elegant. 

â€¼ <b>JSX Differences -</b>
1. Class - className (replaced)
2. for - htmlFor
3. camelcase prop naming convention :- * onclick - onClick, tabindex - tabIndex

â€¼ <b>Props -</b> 
Props is just an object that contains the attributes and their values which have been passed through parent component. They are immutable. 

â€¼ <b>State -</b>
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

â€¼ <b>Props VS State -</b>
<img src="/Assests/PropVsState.png" alt="Prop Vs State"> <br>

â€¼ <b>setState -</b>
1. Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly.
2. Code has to be executed after the state has been updated. Place that code in the call back function which is second argument to setState method.
3. When you have to update state based on the prev state value, pass in a func as an argument instead of regular object. 

â€¼ <b>Destructuring the props and state -</b>
The destructuring is an ES6 feature that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. In React, destructuring props and states improve code readability.

â€¼ <b>Event Handler -</b> <br>
* Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events. React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
* They are function not a function call so don't need to write paranthesis. 

â€¼ <b>Event Binding -</b> <br>
1st Method - Binding in render (Use Bind)  <br>
2nd Method - Arrow function in render <br>
3rd Method - Binding in class constructor (Deals with binding the event handler in constructor as opposed to binding in rendor method.) <br>
4th Method - Class property as arrow function.  <br>

â€¼ <b>Conditional Rendering (UserGreeting.js file)-</b> <br> 
1. When building react application, often need to show or hide some html based on a certain condition, use Conditional Rendering. Conditional Rendering works the same way conditions work in JS. 
2. There are 4 approaches - <br>
a. if/else <br> b. Element variable <br> c. Ternary conditional operator <br> d. Short circuit operator -> Use when we want to print something or nothing

â€¼ <b>List Rendering-</b> <br> 
Transforming arrays into lists of elements. When you're working with React, you will often times need to render lists of items. With the map() method, you can create new results from your current lists or even showcase all the items in your lists.

â€¼ <b>Lists And Keys-</b> 
1. A key is a special string attribute you need to include when creating a list of element.
2. Keys give the element a special identity.
3. Helps react identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

<img src="/Assests/ListWithKey.png" alt="List With Key"> <br>

â€¼ <b>When to use Index As Key-</b> 
1. The items in your list don't have unique id. 
2. The list is a static list and will not change.
3. The list never be reordered or filtered. <br>

<b>Issue:-</b>

â€¼ <b>Styling React Component -</b> 
1. CSS stylesheet
2. Inline styling -> They aren't specified as a string instead they're specified with object whose key is camel case version of the styling and the value is usually a string. 
3. CSS Module -> Available version 2 or higher. File name must be suffix <b>.module.css</b>. Adv - Classes are locally scoped by-default. 
4. CSS in JS libraries

â€¼ <b>Basics of Form Hanling -</b> <br>
<b>Controlled components -</b>
Form elements which are controlled by react, called controlled components. 
```
E.g. 
<input type='text' value={this.state.email} onChange={this.changeEmailHandler} >
```
In react, value of the input field is set to the state property and we use setState method in onChange to update the state.
```
this.state = {
    email: ''
}
this.changeEmailHandler = (event) => {
    this.setState({email:event.target.value})
}
```

â€¼ <b>Life Cycle Methods in a Class Component -</b> 
1. Mounting -> When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into DOM. There are 4 methods: constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and componentDidMount <br>
A) constructor(props) - ðŸŽ— A special function that will get call whenever a new component is created. <br>
ðŸŽ— Initializing state, Binding the event handler. <br>
ðŸŽ— Don't cause side effect. <br>
ðŸŽ—super(props), Directly override this.state
2. Updating -> When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state. There are 5 methods: static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate <br>
3. Unmounting -> When a component is being removed from DOM. There is 1 method: componentWillUnmount <br>
4. Error Handling -> When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in a constructor of any child component. There are 2 methods: static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch <br>
